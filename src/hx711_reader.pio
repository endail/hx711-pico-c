; This program pulls a 32-bit integer from application code and uses
; it to set the gain on the HX711. If an integer is not provided, the
; previously provided integer is used. A default integer of 0
; corresponding to a gain of 128 is used until an integer is provided.
; The integer provided should be in the range 0 to 2, inclusive.
; 
; This program constantly and automatically refills the ISR with the
; newest value from the HX711 without providing a gain value from
; application code.
; 
; The lower 24 bits contain the value from the HX711. The next (upper)
; bits should all be 0, but in any case should be ignored by
; application code.
; 
; Details are given on page 5 of the HX711's datasheet.
; 
; NOTES:
; 
; 1. This program assumes the state machine is running at 10MHz. Each
; instruction/cycle is therefore 100ns (0.1us).
; 
; 2. The 'x' register is used to store the last count of bits to read
; and to preload the OSR with if the OSR is empty. See pg. 350 of the
; RP2040 datasheet for details about this when the 'noblock' option is
; given.
; 
; 3. The 'y' register is used to as the decrement counter for the bit
; read counter. This variable is 0-based.
; 
; 4. When running in serial, there is an overlap between T2 and T3-T4.
; That is to say, the data pin can be read from 100ns after the clock
; pin has gone high. Given each bit is read in serial, the T2 delay is
; not needed.
; 
; 5. With the state machine running at 10MHz:
; 
; T1: With no delay following the wait instruction (ie. []), and
; assuming the the next instruction executes immediately after the wait
; condition is met, the clock pin will go high following that second
; instruction (ie. set pins, 1 [T3 - 1]). The set pins, 1 portion of
; the instruction will take one cycle - 100ns - which is the absolute
; minimum for T1 according to the HX711 datasheet.
; 
; T2: A T2 delay is still unneeded due to the inherent delays in
; reading the data pin and jmp instruction.
; 
; 6. There is a small speedup by side-setting on the gain loop jmp
; instruction.
